Qt JRuby
========

When the most powerful GUI toolkit meets the most flexible language to create a wonderful DSL to build cross-platform applications easily.

Qt JRuby is a kick ass GUI toolkit in JRuby based on Qt Jambi. 

Download
========

You'll need Git to download Qt JRuby source :

	git clone git://github.com/nmerouze/qtjruby.git

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the tarball : http://github.com/nmerouze/qtjruby/tarball/master

Install
=======

Download and install JRuby. Then set JRUBY_HOME :

	export JRUBY_HOME=/path/to/jruby
	
Update PATH with JRUBY_HOME/bin :

	export PATH=$JRUBY_HOME/bin:$PATH

Download Qt Jambi. Put qtjambi-$VERSION.jar and qtjambi-$PLATFORM-$VERSION.jar into JRUBY_HOME/lib folder.

Finally build Qt Jambi JRuby Extensions :

	jruby -S rake jarify:ext

It's just an alias for ant, so you can type :

	ant

Examples
========

You can run the examples with the following command :

	jruby examples/example1.rb
	
You must add -J-XstartOnFirstThread option if you are under Mac OS X.

First Steps
===========

You must require "qt" to use it in your application :

	$:.unshift '/path/to/qtjruby/lib'
	require 'qt'

Then you can create your application :

	Qt.app do
		window :main do
			...
		end
	end

Note that Qt.app opens automatically the window which has the name :main on startup.

The examples are a very good way to see what you can do.

Old fashioned way
=================

But you can make GUI interfaces without the DSL. Every Qt objects can be invoked with the namespace Qt :

	QApplication => Qt::Application
	QPushButton => Qt::PushButton

Deployment
==========

Coming soon...

Compatibility
=============

Qt JRuby has been tested on JRuby 1.1RC3 and Qt Jambi 4.4 Preview but may run with other versions.

Thanks
======

Qt Jambi JRuby Extensions are inspired by Qt Jambi Jython project.

The DSL is largely inspired by Shoes which is a great GUI toolkit in Ruby.
